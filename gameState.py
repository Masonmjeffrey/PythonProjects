## Let's define some variables that will change throughout the game depending on the user state
miles_traveled = 0
food = 1000
health = 10
month = 1
day = 1
sickness = 0
player_name = None
profession = None
totalDays = 1
playState = True
userMoney = 500

## Now let's define some constant variables that will not change during gameplay
## if I decide to implement a Settings menu then these will be changeable
totalDistance = 300
minTurns = 5
maxTurns = 10
maxDays = 60
beginning_food = 1000
huntFactor = 50
travelFactor = 25
